- The CIA Triad
> - 3 pillars (maybe four?) of cybersecurity. 

```
- CIA stands for:
   - C - Confidentiality : Unauthorized Individuals should not access the data. 
   - I - Integrity : Unauthorized Individuals should not modify the data.
   - A - Availability : The system should be available to its users.
```

> - Non-repudiation: Not in CIA but should be considered - It means one should not be able to falsely deny that they created, altered, or has something to do with that data.

- The 5 Functions.
> - It's developed to provide organizations with a framework to establish a systematic approach to manage and improve their security posture.
```
- Identify : Understanding what needs protection.
- Protect : Applying security controls, policies, and safeguards to mitigate the identified issues.
- Detect : Quickly identifying any potential breaches, anomalies, or suspicious activities.
- Respond : Steps to take in response in case of a cybersecurity incident.
- Recover : Recovering to normal operations as quickly as possible.
```

- A Few Security Roles:
> - Not that IMP but good to know.
```
- CISO : Lead person responsible for security in organization
- ISSO : Responsible for securing data
```



--- 

- Security Controls: 
> - Measures to ensure security across the organization.
> - Types: Depending on how we implement them
```
- Technical - Hardware and Software
- Operational - Human factor
- Manegerial - High Level Guidance
```
> - Types: Depending on their goals.
```
- Preventitive - stops attack or prevent it.
- Detective - Record, log, inform, alert or detect the attack
- Corrective - recover from attack
- Deterrent - discourages human attackers
- Compensating - "at least we have this"
- physical - light, camera, doors, etc
```

- Popular Standards and Regulations
```
- GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation for European Contries.
- GLBA - Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act for financial services.
- SOX - Sarbanes–Oxley Act for financial services in US.
- CSA - Computer Security Act
- FISMA - Fedaral Information Security Management Act

- Vulnerability
> - Vulnerability is anything (any sort of weakness) that helps the attacker in attacking or exploiting our system to cause a negative impact.

---

- Threat
> - Threat is the potential of that vulnerability to exploit our system to cause an impact. And how likely that the vulnerability will be exploited.

--- 

- Risk
> - Risk = Vulnerability + Threat

---

- APT - Advanced Persistent Threat
> - This type of attacks are persistent in nature, meaning the hacker can not only exploit the system but can also maintain persistent access to it, also covering the tracks of the attack.

--- 

- Attack Surface
> - How much exposed you are to attack. How many inputs the attacker can tamper with in order to try to gain access to the system.

---

- Attack vector

> - Point of entry by which an attack can happen is known as attack vector.
> - Common attack vectors:

```
- Email
- Removable media
- Wireless
- Websites
- Social Media
- Instant Messaging platform
- Local workstation access
- Cloud
- Supply Chain
```

---

- Threat Intelligence:
> - It refers to the information and knowledge collected about potential cyber threats, like viruses, trojans, hackers, or other malicious activities.

---

- Threat Modeling:
> - It's like creating a map of all possible threats for a system.

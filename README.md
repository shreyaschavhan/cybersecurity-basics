- The CIA Triad
> - 3 pillars (maybe four?) of cybersecurity. 

```
- CIA stands for:
   - C - Confidentiality : Unauthorized Individuals should not access the data. 
   - I - Integrity : Unauthorized Individuals should not modify the data.
   - A - Availability : The system should be available to its users.
```

> - Non-repudiation: Not in CIA but should be considered - It means one should not be able to falsely deny that they created, altered, or has something to do with that data.
